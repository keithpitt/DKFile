# DKFile

`DKFile` is a wrapper around NSFileManager that provides an easier syntax for working with files.

It is used in the apps written by [Mostly Disco](http://www.mostlydisco.com) and [The Frontier Group](http://www.thefrontiergroup.com.au)

## Installation

Copy `DKFile.h` and `DKFile.m` into to your project folder, and add them to your Xcode project.

If you also want to use the `jsonFromBundle:pathForResource:` method, you'll also need to include the `JSON` library found in the External folder.

## Usage

For more documentation, visit http://keithpitt.github.com/DKFile

### Creating a DKFile from a file from a bundle

    // Passing nil uses [NSBundle mainBundle]
    DKFile * file = [DKFile fileFromBundle:nil pathForResource:@"SomeFile" ofType:@"png"];

### Creating a DKFile from a file in the Documents folder

    DKFile * file = [DKFile fileFromDocuments:@"SomeFile.png"];

### Creating a DKFile from a file using a specific path

    // Passing nil uses [NSBundle mainBundle]
    DKFile * file = [[DKFile alloc] initWithPath:@"some/random/path.txt"];

### Writing an NSImage to the file system

    // Create in instance of DKFile
    DKFile * file = [DKFile fileFromDocuments:@"SomeFile.jpg"];

    // Load an image from the bundle
    NSImage * someImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"SomeImage"];

    // Turn the image into data with a compression of 90%
    NSData * imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(someImage, 0.9);

    NSError * error = nil;

    if ([file writeData:imageData error:&error])
      NSLog(@"File save success!");
    else
      NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedDescription]);

### Writing text to the file system

    // Create in instance of DKFile
    DKFile * file = [DKFile fileFromDocuments:@"SomeText.txt"];

    // Turn the text into data
    NSData * textData = [@"Cool Story Bro" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    NSError * error = nil;

    if ([file writeData:textData error:&error])
      NSLog(@"File save success!");
    else
      NSLog(@"%@", [error localizedDescription]);

### Loading JSON from the file system

    // Will read and parse Users.json from [NSBundle mainBundle]
    NSDictionary * json = [DKFile jsonFromBundle:nil pathForResource:@"Users"];

### File contents (for text files)

    DKFile * file = [[DKFile alloc] initWithPath:@"some/random/path.txt"];

    NSLog("Contents of: %@, %@", file.path, [file contents]);

### File existence

    DKFile * file = [[DKFile alloc] initWithPath:@"some/random/path.txt"];

    if ([file exists]) {
        NSLog(@"File exists");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"File DOES NOT exist");
    }

### File attributes

    DKFile * file = [[DKFile alloc] initWithPath:@"some/random/path.txt"];

    NSLog("File size: %i", [file size]);
    NSLog("File modification date: %@", [file lastModificationDate]);
    NSLog("File age: %i", [file age]);

## Running Specs

To run the specs, open [DKFile.xcodeproj](https://github.com/keithpitt/DKFile/tree/master/DKFile.xcodeproj) project, and run the `Specs` target.

## Documentation

To build the documentation, just run `rake` in the root of the project. You will need [appledoc](http://www.gentlebytes.com/home/appledocapp/) installed, and an environment variable `APPLEDOC_TEMPLATE_PATH` set pointing to the path of your appledoc templates.
